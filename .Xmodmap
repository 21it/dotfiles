! Trying to F*** with my keyboard.
!
! The theory is that if I make the caps lock be the "Mode_switch" key,
! then I can change what happens for each key when I press the "Mode_switch" key.
!
! I'm not using the "Mode_switch" key anyway...
!
! This will make the caps lock be the "Mode_switch" key.
clear Lock

! 66 is the Caps_Lock.
keycode 66 = Mode_switch Mode_switch

! This is where we remap any key's Mode_switch symbols.
!
! This is the xmodmap keymap table. This is the structure:
! keycode XX = A B C D
! XX is the keycode (not the keysym, retrieved by xev)
! A is the keysym output when just the key is pressed
! B is the keysym output when the key is pressed + Shift
! C is the keysym output when the key is pressed + Mode_switch (now capslock)
! D is the keysym output when the key is pressed + Shift + Mode_switch (now capslock)
